 - Find the pair with a given sum in a sorted array

    Given a sorted array and a target sum, find if there exists a pair of elements whose sum equals the target.

    Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target = 6

    Output: true (because 2 + 4 = 6)


- Remove duplicates from a sorted array

    Given a sorted array, remove all duplicate elements and return the array's new length.

    Input: arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]

    Output: 4 (unique elements are [1, 2, 3, 4])

 - Find the middle of a linked list

    Use two pointers (slow and fast) to find the middle element of a linked list.

    Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    Output: 3

- Check if a string is a palindrome

    Check if a string reads the same backward as forward.

    Input: str = "madam"

    Output: true

- Merge two sorted arrays

    Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array using two pointers.

    Input: arr1 = [1, 3, 5], arr2 = [2, 4, 6]
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
