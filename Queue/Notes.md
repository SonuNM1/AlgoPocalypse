- Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. The element that is inserted first is removed first. 

- Operations: 

    Enqueue - add an element to the rear of the queue

    Dequeue - remove an element from the front of the queue 

    Peek/Front - Get the front element without removing it
